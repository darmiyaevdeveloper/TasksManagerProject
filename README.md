# TasksManager
# What is it
TasksManager is a way to easily have tasks that are well organized.

TasksManager uses nonfications and a nice UI to encourage you.
# What's different from others?
Something unique is we use a different way of organizing and we use web nonfications, this means a powerful nonfication system that is efficent in it's ways.
# Features
# nonfications
Nonfications remind you depending on how you choose, they also encourage you with quotes.
# parental controls
Parents can create a child account which is controlled by them, you can also reward a child account with coins, there are also helpful stats that show your childs progress.
What if the child just checks off the tasks?
That's where *focus* comes in.
Focus uses ```<iframe>``` which allows your child to only use the website inside of TasksManager and if exited out, the parent is notfied in the dashboard.
